## Collector
Wardriving module for the WifiPineapple.

**Features:**
* Start and stop monitor interfaces
* Start and stop airodump-ng scans

### Dependencies
For now theres no way to directly install dependencies from the module.
The only non included stuff you will need is the Aircrack-ng Suite, which gets installed as a dependencie for the SiteSurvey module. So I recommend to just install it through that module.
